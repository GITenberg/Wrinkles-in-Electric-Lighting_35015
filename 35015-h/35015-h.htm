<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>In the following pages it is my intention to give engineers on board ship,
who may be put in charge of electric lighting machinery without having any
electrical knowledge, some idea of the manner in which electricity is
produced by mechanical means; how it is converted into light; what
precautions must be used to keep the plant in order, and what to do in the
event of difficulties arising. I do not therefore aim at producing a
literary work, but shall try and explain everything in the plainest
language possible.</p>

<h2><span class="smcap"><a name="Ch1" id="Ch1"></a>The Electric Current, and its Production
by Chemical Means.</span></h2>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn1_1" id="Sn1_1"></a>Production of electric current in chemical battery.</span>
It will first be necessary to explain how electric currents are produced by
means of chemicals. In a jar A, <a href="#Fig1">Fig. 1</a>, are placed two plates B and C, one
zinc, and the other copper, each having connected to it at the top a copper
wire of any convenient length. The plates are kept in position by means of
pieces of wood, and the jar is about half filled with a solution of salt
and water, or sulphuric acid and water; if then the two wires are joined, a
current of electricity at once flows through them, however long they may
be.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn1_2" id="Sn1_2"></a>Current very weak.</span>
The current produced in this manner is very weak, and does not even keep
what strength it has for any length of time, but rapidly gets weaker until
quite imperceptible. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span> current is, however, continuous; that is, it
flows steadily in the one direction through the wire, and may be used for
ringing bells, or for other purposes where a feeble current only is
required to do intermittent work. The wire E in connection with the copper
plate is called the positive lead, and the other the negative, and the
current is said to flow from the copper plate, through the wire E through
the circuit to D, and thence to the zinc plate, and through the liquid to
the copper plate.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn1_3" id="Sn1_3"></a>Current compared to circulation of the blood.</span>
The current has often been compared to water flowing through a pipe, but I
think it can be better compared to the blood in the human body, which
through the action of the heart is continually forced through the arteries
and veins in one steady stream. There is, however, this difference, that
there is no actual progression of matter in the electric current, it being
like a ripple on water, which moves from end to end of a lake without the
water itself being moved across. Now that I have given you an idea of how
the current acts, I must try and explain how different degrees of strength
and volume are obtained.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><p class="captop">Fig. 1.</p><a name="Fig1" id="Fig1"></a>
<img src="images/illo012.png" alt="Chemical Battery" /></div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn1_4" id="Sn1_4"></a>Strength and volume of current.</span>
In the first place, let us consider what constitute strength and volume in
an electric current, or at least try and get a general notion about them.
For this purpose I shall compare the electric current to water being forced
through a pipe; and the strength of the electric current, or electromotive
force, written for short E.M.F., will be like the pressure of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span> water at any
part of the pipe. Two pipes may carry different quantities of water, and
yet the pressure may be the same in each; in one a gallon of water may pass
a given point in the same time that a pint passes the same point in the
other, and yet in each case the different quantities may pass that point at
the same speed. Thus in electricity, two currents may be of different
volume or quantity, measured in amp&egrave;res, and yet be of the same E.M.F.
measured in volts; or they may be of different E.M.F., or pressure, or
intensity, and yet be of the same volume. If any work is to be done by the
water forced through a pipe, such as turning a turbine, it is evident that
pressure of itself is not sufficient, seeing that a stream an inch in
diameter may be at the same pressure as another a foot in diameter.
So with the electric current, if work is to be done, such as driving a
motor or lighting a lamp, it is not sufficient to have a certain E.M.F.;
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn1_5" id="Sn1_5"></a>Pressure not sufficient without volume.</span>
there must be quantity or volume in proportion to the amount of work, so
that if it takes a given quantity to work one lamp, it will take twice that
quantity to work two lamps of the same kind. It must not be inferred from
this, that if one lamp requires a certain E.M.F., that two lamps will
require it to be doubled, as such is not the case, except under certain
conditions which I will explain <a href="#Sn4_6">later on</a>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn1_6" id="Sn1_6"></a>Action of current is instantaneous.</span>
The action of electricity is practically instantaneous in any length of
wire, so that if the current<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span> is used to ring two bells a mile apart, but
connected by wires, they will commence to ring simultaneously. I have so
far not said anything about resistance to the passage of the current
through the wires. I shall therefore refer again to our comparison of the
current to water forced through a pipe, and you will agree that a certain
sized pipe will only convey a certain amount of water in a given time. If a
larger quantity is to be conveyed in the same time, a greater pressure must
be applied, or a larger pipe must be used.</p>

<p>It is evident that increasing the size of the pipe will get over the
difficulty more readily than increasing the pressure of the water. The
pipes themselves offer a certain resistance to the passage of the water
through them, in the shape of friction; so that if an effect is to be
produced at a distance, rather more pressure is required than if it is done
close at hand, so as to make up for the loss sustained by friction.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn1_7" id="Sn1_7"></a>Resistance to the passage of the current.</span>
Much the same may be said of the electric current; a certain sized wire
will only carry a certain current, and if more current is required, a
thicker wire must be used to convey it, or it must be of a greater E.M.F.
It is usually more convenient to increase the thickness of the wire than to
increase the E.M.F. of the current. The wire offers a certain resistance to
the passage of the current through it, which may be compared to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span> friction,
and this resistance varies according to the metal of which it is composed.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn1_8" id="Sn1_8"></a>Copper the usual metal for conductors.</span>
Copper is the metal in ordinary use for wires for electric lighting
purposes, and the purer it is the better will it convey the current. Iron
is used for telegraph wires on account of cheapness, the current used being
so small that this metal conveys it readily enough; if copper were used,
the wires will only require to be about one-third the diameter of the iron
ones. The following are the respective values for electrical conductivity
of various metals when pure, taking silver as a standard:&mdash;Silver 100,
copper 99&middot;9, gold 80, zinc 29, brass 22, iron 16&middot;8, tin 13&middot;1, lead 8&middot;3,
mercury 1&middot;6.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn1_9" id="Sn1_9"></a>Heat produced by current when wire is too small.</span>
If a wire is made to convey a current which is too large for its electrical
capacity, it will get heated, which decreases its conductivity, with the
result that the heat increases until finally the wire fuses. I shall have
more to say about this when speaking of electric lighting.</p>

<hr class="c25" />
<h2><a name="Ch2" id="Ch2"></a><span class="smcap">Production of Electric Currents by
Mechanical Means.</span></h2>


<h3><i><a name="Ch2a" id="Ch2a"></a>Magneto-electric Machines.</i></h3>

<p>I have shown how the electric current is produced by the action of chemical
or primary batteries, and how this current will flow through suitable
conductors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2a_1" id="Sn2a_1"></a>Current produced by mechanical means.</span>
I shall now explain how mechanical power may be converted into electricity.
It has been found that if a wire, preferably of copper, of which the ends
are joined together, is moved past a magnet a current is induced in the
wire, flowing in one direction while the wire is approaching the magnet,
and in the opposite direction while it is receding from it.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2a_2" id="Sn2a_2"></a>Alternating current.</span>
This is then not a continuous current like we obtained from the chemical
battery, but an alternating one, and you will see <a href="#Sn2b_9">later</a> on how it can be
made to produce similar effects. The oftener the wire passes the magnet the
more electricity is generated, so that if we make a coil of the wire and
move a large number of parts of wire past at one time, the effects on each
part are accumulated; and if instead of having one magnet to pass before,
we have several, the effects will be doubled or trebled, &amp;c., in proportion
to the number. If, again, the coil is moved at an increased speed past the
magnets, the effects will be still further increased.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig2" id="Fig2"></a><p class="captop">Fig. 2.</p>
<img src="images/illo018.png" alt="Commutator" /></div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2a_3" id="Sn2a_3"></a>Magneto-electric machines.</span>
The knowledge of these facts led to the construction of the various
magneto-electric machines, of which a familiar type is seen in those small
ones used for medical purposes. They contain a large horse-shoe magnet,
close to the end of which two bobbins of copper wire are made to revolve at
a high speed, and all who have used these machines know that the more
quickly they turn the handle the greater shock the person receives who is
being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span> operated upon.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2a_4" id="Sn2a_4"></a>Shock produced by interruption of current.</span>
The current generated is really very feeble, the shock being produced by
interrupting it at every half revolution by means of a small spring or
other suitable mechanism. If the current is not so interrupted, it cannot
be felt at all, which may be proved by lifting up the spring on the spindle
of the ordinary kind. The current is an alternating one, and changes its
direction throughout the circuit, however extended it may be, at every half
revolution.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2a_5" id="Sn2a_5"></a>The current must be commutated.</span>
If it is required to have a continuous current, use must be made of what is
termed a commutator, and I shall endeavour to explain the manner in which
it acts as simply as possible. Without going into any further details as to
the construction of the bobbins, and their action at any particular moment,
I shall content myself with saying that if the wire on the two bobbins is
continuous, and the ends are connected, the current will flow one way
during half a revolution, and the other way during the other half.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2a_6" id="Sn2a_6"></a>Description of commutator.</span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>Now, in <a href="#Fig2">Fig. 2</a>,
on the spindle A on which the bobbins are fixed, is fitted
a split collar formed of two halves B and C, to which are joined
respectively the ends of the wires + and -.
This collar is insulated from the spindle by a suitable insulating
material, that is to say, a material which does not conduct electricity,
such as wood, ivory, &amp;c., and is represented in <a href="#Fig2">Fig. 2</a> by the dark parts D.
So far the circuit is not complete, so that however quickly you turn the
machine no current is produced. If, however, some means is employed for
joining B and C by a conductor, the alternating current is produced as
before. In <a href="#Fig3">Fig. 3</a>, I show a section through B A C. On a base E made of
wood, are fixed two metal springs F and G, which are made to press against
B and C respectively; wires are connected at H and K, which, joined
together, complete the circuit. A continuous current is said to be + or
positive where it leaves a battery, and - or negative where it returns; it
will be convenient to use these signs and terms in the following
explanation.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2a_7" id="Sn2a_7"></a>Current though alternating in the dynamo, is continuous in the circuit.</span>
At one portion of the revolution the spindle will be in the
position shown in <a href="#Fig3">Fig. 3</a>, and the + current is flowing into B, through F,
to the terminal H, thence through the circuit to the terminal K,<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span> through G
to C, and so back through the - wire to the bobbins of the machine. In <a href="#Fig4">Fig.
4</a> the spindle has made a half revolution, bringing B in contact with G, and
C with F. But by this half turn the current is reversed in the bobbins, and the +
current flows into C, through F, to terminal H as before, and through the
circuit to K, through G and B, back to the bobbins.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2a_8" id="Sn2a_8"></a>Continuous current used for electro-plating.</span>
Thus you see that in the circuit the current will be always in the same
direction, or continuous, although in the bobbins it is alternating, and
may be used for any purpose for which a continuous current is required,
such as electro-plating, &amp;c.</p>

<h3><i><a name="Ch2b" id="Ch2b"></a>Dynamo-electric Machines.</i></h3>

<p>It will now be necessary to explain the nature of a dynamo-electric
machine, called, for shortness, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
dynamo, and to show in what it differs
from a magneto-electric machine.</p>

<p>I have explained how an electric current is produced by a wire passing in
front of a magnet; now, this magnet may either be of the ordinary kind, or
it may be what is termed an electro-magnet.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2b_1" id="Sn2b_1"></a>Current will magnetise an iron or steel bar.</span>
One of the effects which electricity can be made to produce is the
magnetising of steel bars to form the ordinary and well-known permanent
magnets which are used in ships&#8217; compasses, &amp;c. To produce this effect,
part of the wire in a circuit is made into a spiral as in <a href="#Fig5">Fig. 5</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig5" id="Fig5"></a><p class="captop">Fig. 5.</p>
<img src="images/illo021.png" alt="Spiral wire" /></div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2b_2" id="Sn2b_2"></a>Permanent magnet.</span>
The steel rod to be magnetised is placed within the spiral, and a
continuous current of electricity is then sent through the wire, which
causes the rod to become magnetised with a North pole at one end, and a
South pole at the other. The more current is passed through the circuit,
and the more turns are in the spiral, the more quickly and strongly is the
rod magnetised; and it will retain its magnetism for an indefinite time if
made of suitable steel. There is a point at which the metal is said to be
saturated with magnetism, and the strength it has then acquired will be
that which it will retain afterwards, although while under the influence of
the current that strength may be considerably exceeded.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2b_3" id="Sn2b_3"></a>Electro-magnet.</span>
If instead of a steel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span> rod one of iron is placed in the spiral, and the
current is passed through as before, it will be magnetised in the same
manner; but as soon as the current is stopped, the rod loses almost all its
magnetism, and if the current is then passed in the opposite direction the
rod will be magnetised in the opposite way. The softer and more homogeneous
is the iron, the more instantaneously will it acquire and lose its
magnetism, and the greater strength of magnetism it is able to acquire. An
iron bar, round which are wound a large number of turns of insulated or
covered wire, constitutes an electro-magnet.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2b_4" id="Sn2b_4"></a>Where the magneto and dynamo machines differ.</span>
The difference then between a magneto-electric and a dynamo-electric
machine is, that in the former permanent magnets are used, and in the
latter electro-magnets take their place. I do not intend to go into
particulars as to the construction of the various dynamos in present use,
as there are many books to be had in which these machines are fully
described. I need merely say that in the so-called continuous-current
dynamos, the whole or part of the current produced is made to pass through
the coils of the electro-magnets, thus inducing in them the required
magnetism. I showed how, in the magneto-electric machine, the currents are
collected by means of a commutator, and it is evident that in <a href="#Fig2">Figs. 2</a>, <a href="#Fig3">3</a>,
and <a href="#Fig4">4</a> there might be separate wires coming from each bobbin to B and C; and
if there were more than two bobbins, there might still be<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span> two wires from
each to B and C. On the other hand the collecting collar might be split
into more sections; in fact there might be as many sections as bobbins. To
show how the current is collected in continuous-current dynamos, I must
give a short explanation of the revolving part or armature of a standard
type of machine.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig6" id="Fig6"></a><p class="captop">Fig. 6.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2b_5" id="Sn2b_5"></a>Armature of so-called continuous-current dynamo.</span>
In <a href="#Fig6">Fig. 6</a> is shown a horse-shoe magnet, with its North and South poles, N
and S. Between these poles is made to revolve the armature, composed of a
number of coils of wire made to form a ring like a life-buoy. The ends of
the wires are made to lie along a collar on the spindle, made of some
insulating material, each wire being parallel to its neighbour, and kept
separate from it, as shown in <a href="#Fig7">Fig. 7</a>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig7" id="Fig7"></a><p class="captop">Fig. 7.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2b_6" id="Sn2b_6"></a>Type of commutator.</span>
These wires are so arranged that if one end of a sectional coil is on top
of the spindle at a given moment, the other will be on the under side.
If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span> then, as shown in
<a href="#Fig7">Fig. 7</a>, a rubber of copper, made in the form of a

part of the commutator collar, and another similar one with the lower, it
is evident the circuit will be completed in the same manner as before
explained.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2b_8" id="Sn2b_8"></a>Current continuous in the circuit.</span>
A wire which is + when above the spindle, will be - when below it, and as
the spindle revolves the current changes in the various wires from - to +<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
as they reach the top, so that it will always therefore be + in the upper
brush and - in the lower one, and will accordingly be continuous through
the circuit. It will be seen in the illustrations of various
continuous-current dynamos, that though their shape and arrangement differ,
the mode of collecting the current is much about the same as I have
described above. <a href="#Fig8">Figs. 8</a> and <a href="#Fig9">9</a> show some of the continuous-current dynamos
at present in use.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2b_9" id="Sn2b_9"></a>Alternating-current dynamos.</span>
I will now explain the nature of an alternating-current dynamo.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig10" id="Fig10"></a><p class="captop">Fig. 10.</p>
<img src="images/illo026.png" alt="Alternate polarities" /></div>

<p>The principal difference between the continuous-and alternating-current
dynamo, is in the number of magnets used. Most of the former have only four
magnets, while the latter have frequently as many as thirty-two.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2b_10" id="Sn2b_10"></a>Current not commutated.</span>
In reality, as I have shown, these are all alternating-current dynamos,
only that in the so-called continuous-current ones, the current is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
commutated, whereas in the others it is not, but is used as it is produced.
In the principal alternating-current dynamos, a number of small magnets,
usually sixteen, are attached to a framework directly opposite a similar
number of others of the same size, the space between the ends being only
about an inch or two. These are all electro-magnets, and are wound in such
manner that when excited by a current, every alternate one shall have the
same magnetism, as in <a href="#Fig10">Fig. 10</a>, and every opposite one a contrary magnetism.</p>

<p class="capbot">Siemens Armature.</p></div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2b_11" id="Sn2b_11"></a>Intense magnetic field produced.</span>
This produces an intense magnetic field between the ends of the magnets,
and in this space revolves the armature. This armature, in the Siemens
dynamo, is composed of a disc having as many bobbins on the periphery as
there are magnets on each side of the dynamo. As each bobbin approaches
each magnet a current is induced in one direction, which is reversed when
the bobbin recedes; thus an alternating current is produced, which is
collected by connecting the ends to insulated rings or collars on the
spindle, and having small copper brushes or rubbers in contact with them.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2b_12" id="Sn2b_12"></a>Simplicity of Ferranti armature.</span>
In the Ferranti dynamo, the armature is quite different, and much more
simple, as comparison of <a href="#Fig11">Figs. 11</a> and <a href="#Fig12">12</a> will show.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig12" id="Fig12"></a><p class="captop">Fig. 12.</p>

<p>It consists of a copper tape bent in and out so as to form a sort of star
with eight arms, the number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
layers of insulated copper tape being from
ten to thirty, according to requirements. The centre is made in a similar
shape with bolts or rivets holding each convolution in place. The two ends
of the tape are attached respectively to two collector-rings on the
spindle, against which press two solid metal rubbers which carry off the
current for use in the circuit. It can be shown that as each arm approaches
a magnet a current will be induced in one direction, which will be reversed
as each arm recedes; and therefore an alternating current will be produced.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2b_13" id="Sn2b_13"></a>Large number of alternations of the current.</span>
As there are sixteen magnets for the armature to pass at each revolution,
there must be sixteen alternations of the current during the same time, so
that if the speed of the armature is 500 revolutions per minute, there will
be 500 &times; 16 = 8000 alternations in one minute. These alternations being so
extremely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> rapid, when this current is used for electric lighting, the
steadiness of the light will be in no way affected, but will remain as
constant as with a continuous current.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2b_14" id="Sn2b_14"></a>Alternating current cannot be used to excite an electro-magnet.</span>
The alternating current produced by these dynamos cannot be used for
exciting an electro-magnet, as the magnetism would be reversed at every
alternation;
a separate small dynamo of the continuous type is therefore used as an
exciter to magnetise all the electro-magnets in the field, and it is
usually coupled on to the same spindle, and therefore goes at the same
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2b_15" id="Sn2b_15"></a>Exciter coupled on to same spindle as dynamo.</span>
speed as the alternating-current dynamo.
The exciter is usually of a size to be able to do alone<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span> about one-tenth to
one-twentieth of the work that the larger machines does in the way of
lighting; so that if from any cause the latter is disabled while the ship
lighted by it is at sea, the exciter may be used alone to do a portion of
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn2b_16" id="Sn2b_16"></a>Power of exciter if used alone.</span>
the lighting, in the first-class saloon for instance. This can only be done
if the exciter is so constructed as to give the proper E.M.F. that the
lamps require.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn3_1" id="Sn3_1"></a>Production of electric light.</span>
I have explained how power can be converted into electric currents, either
continuous or alternating, and I must now show how these currents can be
applied to the production of light.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig15" id="Fig15"></a><p class="captop">Fig. 15.</p>
<img src="images/illo030.png" alt="Arc Light" /></div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn3_2" id="Sn3_2"></a>Arc lights.</span>
The current may be used to produce an <i>arc light</i> in the following
manner:&mdash;Two carbon rods, A and B, are held by suitable means in the
position shown in <a href="#Fig15">Fig. 15</a>, and the two wires from a dynamo are joined
respectively to A and B, the upper one always being the positive lead when
a continuous current is used. When the current is sent through the circuit,
it passes through the carbons A and B, which are conductors. Immediately
this occurs, suitable mechanism in the lamp, being acted on by the current,
or by hand in the case of search-lights, or by clock-work, moves the two
carbons a small distance apart, with the consequence that a dazzling arc of
light is formed between them.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn3_3" id="Sn3_3"></a>Mechanism to regulate carbons.</span>
If the carbons get too far apart, the mechanism brings them nearer together
again, and on the delicacy with which it acts, depends the steadiness of
the light. It would be useless to explain how this mechanism acts, as it is
in a different form in each maker&#8217;s lamp.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn3_4" id="Sn3_4"></a>Some lamps suitable for alternating current.</span>
Some lamps have been constructed for use with an alternating current, but
with the majority a continuous current is used.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> While an arc light is
burning the carbons waste away, the upper one more rapidly than the lower,
and the mechanism has to approach them constantly to make up for this
waste.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn3_5" id="Sn3_5"></a>When carbons are consumed light goes out.</span>
When the carbons are consumed as far as convenient, an automatic
arrangement cuts off the current, and the light goes out; or it diverts the
current to another set of carbons, which at once light up. The carbons are
made in suitable lengths to last a certain number of hours, four, six,
eight, &amp;c. In <a href="#Fig16">Fig. 16</a> is shown an arc lamp complete.</p>

<p class="capbot">Arc Lamp Complete.</p></div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn3_6" id="Sn3_6"></a>Arc lamp very complicated.</span>
An arc lamp is of necessity a complicated affair, which it is not advisable
to have on board ship, except where an electrician is engaged permanently.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn3_7" id="Sn3_7"></a>Jablochkoff candle.</span>
Another way of producing light is to use the current in what is called an
<i>electric candle</i>, of which a familiar type is the Jablochkoff candle.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig17" id="Fig17"></a><p class="captop">Fig. 17.</p>
<img src="images/illo032.png" alt="Jablochkoff Candle" /></div>

<p><a href="#Fig17">Fig. 17</a> shows the form of this candle, A and B being two carbon rods
parallel to one another, and joined, but at the same time insulated from
one another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span> by kaolin, a sort of chalky substance, which is a
non-conductor.</p>

<p>The wires C and D from the dynamo are joined respectively to A and B
through metallic supports, as in an arc lamp, and when the current is
turned on it flows through C A and across by a small strip of carbon E to B
and D back to the dynamo.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn3_8" id="Sn3_8"></a>Arc formed between the carbons.</span>
The strip E is only large enough to carry the current across for a moment,
and is immediately consumed, but an arc of light is then formed between the
carbons as in the arc lamp. As the carbons consume, the kaolin in between
burns away, just in the same manner as, in an ordinary candle, the wick is
consumed and the wax melts and burns away, except that in the latter case
the wax feeds the light, whereas the kaolin is only used to keep the
carbons the required distance apart and the arc of light from running down
them.<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn3_9" id="Sn3_9"></a>Candles require alternating current.</span>
It is evident that the carbons must be consumed equally, for which reason
use must be made of the alternating current. Any unsteadiness that occurs
in the light produced is consequent on unsteadiness of the current, or
impurities in the carbons, &amp;c., there being no mechanism of any kind
required. These candles do not give such a great light as arc lights, but
it is of the same nature in every way. <a href="#Fig18">Fig. 18</a> shows one of these candles
in its holder, from which can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22"
id="Page_22">[22]</a></span> seen how electrical contact is made with
the two carbons.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig18" id="Fig18"></a><p class="captop">Fig. 18.</p>
<img src="images/illo033.png" alt="Jablochkoff Candle in Holder" /></div>

<p>If the current is interrupted in any way, and the light goes out, it will
not be produced again automatically, but requires a small piece of carbon
between the two carbons as a path for the current to pass across as in the
beginning.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn3_10" id="Sn3_10"></a>Incandescent lamps.</span>
A third form of electric light is produced by using the current in an
<i>incandescent lamp</i>.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig19" id="Fig19"></a><p class="captop">Fig. 19.</p>
<img src="images/illo034a.png" alt="Swan Lamp" /></div>

<p>To explain the action of an incandescent lamp, I must refer back to what I
said about wires getting heated by a current being passed through them
which was too large for their capacity. If two large wires are joined by a
small one, and a strong current is passed through the circuit, the small
wire rapidly gets red hot, and finally fuses.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn3_11" id="Sn3_11"></a>Vacuum formed in lamp prevents combustion</span>
If this small wire is contained in a globe from which the air is exhausted,
when the current is passed through it, it gets red,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span> then white hot, and
when very brilliant gets fused. If, instead of wire, we have in the small
globe a thin filament of carbon, when the current is passed through, we get
a brilliant light which remains constant because the carbon does not fuse,
and it cannot burn away for want of air. <a href="#Fig19">Fig. 19</a> shows a Swan lamp, and
<a href="#Fig20">Fig. 20</a> an Edison lamp, both made on this principle.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig20" id="Fig20"></a><p class="captop">Fig. 20.</p>
<img src="images/illo034b.png" alt="Edison Lamp" /></div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn3_12" id="Sn3_12"></a>Vacuum not perfect.</span>
If in these lamps the vacuum were perfect, the carbon filament would never
get consumed; it is, however, impossible to get a perfect vacuum, but the
better it is, the longer will the filament last. Incandescent lamps are the
only ones that are suitable for house or ship lighting.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn3_13" id="Sn3_13"></a>Advantages of incandescent lamps for house and ship lighting.</span>
They give a yellowish light like a good gas-flame, they do not consume the
air of a room, they cause no smell, and only give out a very slight heat.
They are perfectly safe, because if the globe gets broken and allows air to
get in, the filament is instantly consumed, and the light goes out. They
can be put in all sorts of places where it would be impossible to<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span> have any
other lamps, such as near the ceiling, close to curtains, in a room full of
explosives or combustibles, and even under water.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn3_14" id="Sn3_14"></a>Unaffected by wind, and suitable for either continuous or alternating
currents.</span>
They are not affected by wind; they can therefore be used under punkahs, or
near open windows, sky-lights, or ports, or in the open air. These lamps
can be used with either continuous or alternating currents, but will
probably last longer with the latter, because, when a continuous current is
used, particles of the carbon of the filament appear to be conveyed from
one end of the filament to the other, reducing the thickness at the one
end, until finally it breaks. This evidently cannot occur with an
alternating current, as the impulse in one direction is counteracted by the
following one in the opposite direction. If the current used is of too high
a tension for the lamps, they will show an intensely brilliant light for a
short time, but the filament will soon be destroyed, and the lamp rendered
useless.</p>


<hr class="c25" />
<h2><a name="Ch4" id="Ch4"></a><span class="smcap">Leads.</span></h2>

<p>We have now to consider the means used for conveying the current,
continuous or alternating, to the lamps we intend to use.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn4_1" id="Sn4_1"></a>Leads made usually of copper wire.</span>
The leads for the electric current, which correspond in some measure with
the pipes which convey gas, are made of copper wire, as pure as can be
obtained, covered with some insulating material to prevent the escape of
the current through contact with other conductors. The<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> size of the wire is
regulated according to the amount of current which is to be conveyed; it
will do no harm to have it of twice the required section, but if it is of
less than the required section, it will offer so much resistance to the
passage of the current, that it will probably get fused in a very short
time.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn4_2" id="Sn4_2"></a>Short circuit.</span>
If the lead attached to one terminal of the dynamo comes back to the other
terminal without there being any lamps in the circuit, or other means of
making use of the current, it is said to be short circuited, and if the
dynamo is kept going something must give out very soon. The two leads must
therefore never be connected with one another, except by a lamp or other
resistance, and the manner in which the lamps are placed, and the size of
the leads, depend upon the relative tension and quantity of current and the
kind of lamps to be used.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn4_3" id="Sn4_3"></a>High E.M.F. for arc lights, but low for incandescent.</span>
If the current is to be used in arc lamps it is usual to have a high
E.M.F., which allows of the leads being of small section; but if it is to
be used in incandescent lamps it is found more convenient to have a low
E.M.F., and as this implies a large quantity of current, the leads have to
be of large section.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn4_4" id="Sn4_4"></a>Arc lights in series.</span>
Arc lamps usually require to be placed in series, that is to say, in such a
manner that the current, after leaving the dynamo, passes through each lamp
in succession. The E.M.F. required in this case is the sum of the E.M.F.
for each lamp, the quantity required being the same as for one lamp. This<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
accounts for the high E.M.F. used in arc lighting and the small size of the
wire for conducting the current.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn4_5" id="Sn4_5"></a>Incandescent lamps in parallel circuit.</span>
Incandescent lamps can be either in series or parallel, and frequently the
two systems are combined. To explain the meaning of having lamps parallel,
we will suppose the two leads from a dynamo to be taken along a wall,
parallel to one another, and about six inches apart, ending at the end of
the wall, but not connected in any way. If we then place lamps at intervals
between the two leads, connecting one loop of each to the upper lead, and
the other to the lower lead, by means of small copper wire, these lamps are
said to be all parallel.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn4_6" id="Sn4_6"></a>E.M.F. same for one lamp as for a number.</span>
In this arrangement the current required is the sum of the quantity
necessary for each lamp, but the E.M.F. is the same as that required for
one lamp of the same kind. As we therefore require to send a large quantity
of current through the leads at a small pressure or E.M.F., these leads
must be of large section. In the above arrangement each lamp may be turned
on or off separately without affecting the others. Sometimes two or more
lamps are placed in groups between the parallel leads; these are then in
series with regard to one another, and can only be turned on or off two or
more at a time, in other words, one group at a time.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn4_7" id="Sn4_7"></a>If lamps suitable, each one turns on and off separately.</span>
If our dynamo is producing a current of 100 volts E.M.F. when working at
its proper speed, and our lamps are 100-volt lamps, we shall be able to
turn each lamp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span> on or off separately; but if we want to put in 50-volt
lamps, we must place two together, and we shall then have to turn them on
or off two at a time. I am supposing that in both cases the lamps require
the same quantity of current, though of different E.M.F.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn4_8" id="Sn4_8"></a>Safety fuses.</span>
To prevent the lamps being spoilt by the current being too strong through a
sudden increase in the speed of the dynamo, as also to prevent the leads
getting fused, and perhaps setting fire to the casing, it is usual to have
safety fuses in various parts of the circuit. These are of different kinds,
but a typical one consists of a small lead wire, large enough to carry the
normal current, but which fuses when the current is too strong, and at once
interrupts its passage. The lamps in the same portion of the circuit are
then extinguished and so saved from destruction, and cannot then be lighted
again until the fuse is renewed, which, however, can be done with ease.</p>


<hr class="c25" />
<h2><a name="Ch5" id="Ch5"></a><span class="smcap">Ship Lighting.</span></h2>

<p>We will consider now the case of a steamship to be lighted by means of
incandescent lamps. It is sometimes a matter of some difficulty to fix on a
suitable position for the dynamo and engine, especially in ships which have
already been running for some time.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_1" id="Sn5_1"></a>Position for dynamo.</span>
In selecting a position, it must be borne in mind<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span> that a dynamo will work
best in a cool clean place, cleanliness being most important. If a lot of
coal dust is flying about where the dynamo is working, it will be drawn
into it, and tend to impair its electrical, as well as mechanical
efficiency.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_2" id="Sn5_2"></a>Dynamo to be kept clean and cool.</span>
If the dynamo is kept properly lubricated, it will work well enough in a
hot place, but we must remember that the heating of the wire which makes up
a large portion of the dynamo, reduces its conductivity, so that the cooler
it is kept the better. The dynamo should be so placed that the engineer can
get to every side of it easily.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_3" id="Sn5_3"></a>Quick-speed engines.</span>
If a quick-speed engine is to be used for driving it direct, it will make a
very compact installation, but there seems to be some difficulty as yet in
getting suitable reliable engines, besides which many marine engineers
object to quick-speed engines altogether.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_4" id="Sn5_4"></a>Slow-speed engines with belts.</span>
If a slow-speed engine is to be used, a belt is of course required to get
the necessary speed on the dynamo, and various precautions are needful to
prevent the belt slipping off the pulley when the ship is rolling about in
a sea-way. In all cases, the engine and dynamo should be placed with their
spindles fore-and-aft, or in a line with the ship&#8217;s keel, the rolling being
felt more than the pitching.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_5" id="Sn5_5"></a>Means of keeping belt on the pulley.</span>
There are various ways of keeping the belt from slipping off the pulley.
Some have flanges on the pulley, others have guides or rollers on each side
of the belt, each plan having its advantages and disadvantages; but some
plan must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
used, otherwise the belt slips off, usually in the middle of
the first-saloon dinner, and out go all the lights, besides which the belt
may be considerably damaged before the engine can be stopped.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_6" id="Sn5_6"></a>Engine must work steadily.</span>
The engine must be one that will work very steadily, otherwise the lights
will pulsate at each revolution of the engine, which is most unpleasant. If
the engine is a single one, it must have a large fly-wheel, or a
driving-wheel large and heavy enough to answer the same purpose.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_7" id="Sn5_7"></a>A good sensitive governor wanted.</span>
The engine requires a good sensitive governor, so as to keep the speed
regular when some of the lamps are turned on or off. When the engine and
dynamo are in the main engine-room, the throttle-valve, or a stop-valve,
should be in a convenient place for the engineer on watch to get at so as
to instantly shut off the steam if the belt slips off or breaks. In ships
where an electrician is carried there will not be the same necessity for
this precaution.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_8" id="Sn5_8"></a>The belt must be kept tight.</span>
It is necessary to have some means of tightening up the belt, so as to keep
it from slipping round the pulley. Where the engine and dynamo are on the
same level there may be a screw arrangement in the base-plate of the latter
by which the distance between centres can be increased. Where the engine
and dynamo are on different levels, and the latter is a fixture, recourse
must be had to a roller, bearing against the upper part of the belt and
capable of screw adjustment. If link leather belting is used, it will be
found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
necessary to take out several rows of links each day until it has
finished stretching.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_9" id="Sn5_9"></a>A handy belt stretcher.</span>
A very handy thing to use for this purpose, and which can be made on board
by an engineer, is a double clamp with a screw in between, just like the
ones which are being sold for stretching trousers which have got baggy at
the knees. Whatever belt is used, it is very important that there should be
no joint or inequality which can cause a jump or slip when going over the
pulley, as this will cause the lights to pulsate each time.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_10" id="Sn5_10"></a>Friction gearing.</span>
In America friction gearing has been tried, but I do not know with what
success. From my experience of friction gearing, I am inclined to think it
might do very well. There is certainly no doubt that direct-acting
quick-speed engines are the ones to use, and it is only a question of
getting a suitable one.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_11" id="Sn5_11"></a>Switch-board near dynamo.</span>
The dynamo being firmly fixed in position, the main leads are connected to
it, and carried along to the switch-board, which should be in a convenient
position near at hand. On this switch-board are usually placed the large
safety fuses. The board should have a cover to it, to prevent any one
meddling with it, and to keep it clean. The main leads are of a large size,
and from these other smaller ones branch off, being spliced and soldered to
them.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_12" id="Sn5_12"></a>Leads of different colours.</span>
It is a very good practice to use leads of two different colours, as we can
then work by the following rule: Never connect together two leads of
different colours except by means of a lamp or other<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span> resistance. The size
of the various leads depends on the current to be conveyed, and is a matter
for the electricians.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_13" id="Sn5_13"></a>Main leads and branch leads.</span>
On the main-deck of a large passenger steamer, the main leads may be
carried along side by side under the upper deck, and from these, smaller
ones branch off into the various sets of rooms, smaller ones still going
into each room. In each room there will be one lamp with its switch to turn
it on or off as desired, and a safety fuse.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_14" id="Sn5_14"></a>Lamps held in frosted globes.</span>
The lamps are held in small brackets, and are contained when desired in
frosted globes, which diffuse the light and make it very pleasant. When
these globes are held rigidly in the brackets, the least knock breaks them.
A very good bracket I have seen in use is one which allows the globe to
move about on its support when touched, being at the same time sufficiently
a fixture to resist the motion of the ship; and in the particular ship in
which I saw these used in the first saloon, there was not a single breakage
during a four months&#8217; voyage.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_15" id="Sn5_15"></a>Switches for each lamp.</span>
The switches for turning each light on or off can be under the control of
the passengers, or, on the other hand, they can be fitted to work with keys
kept by the stewards, as thought most desirable.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_16" id="Sn5_16"></a>Lamps of various candle-powers.</span>
The lamps used can be of various candle-powers, within certain limits, and
of whatever make is considered best. They can also be of various makes, as
long as they are constructed to stand the same E.M.F. The lamps in the
passenger berths give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
quite sufficient light if of 10-candle power; the
ones for lighting the saloons, passages, and other large spaces, may with
advantage be of 20-candle power. In these days of luxurious travelling,
when the various lines are trying to attract passengers to their particular
ships, what follows may be thought worth consideration. In steamers going
through the tropics to India, China, Australia, &amp;c., it is usual to get up
dances, concerts, and other entertainments on the quarter-deck, at times
when it would be impossible to do anything below on account of the heat.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_17" id="Sn5_17"></a>Plan for lighting quarter-deck at times.</span>
The quarter-deck then has to be lighted up. This is effected by means of
globe oil-lamps hung about here and there, two being hung in front of the
piano, in unpleasant proximity to the head of the obliging lady pianist.
Now in a ship lighted by electricity, there is no reason why a couple of
leads should not be brought up from below through a skylight or other
opening, on to the quarter-deck.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_18" id="Sn5_18"></a>Arrangement of temporary leads.</span>
Indeed the leads might be arranged to screw into a place in the deck, or on
the side of a skylight, just in the same manner as a hose is connected for
washing decks. These leads would have holders for lamps fitted permanently
at intervals, and when required for use would be stopped up along the
awning-spar or ridge-chains, and the lamps screwed or hooked into the
holders. With a few handy men, five or ten minutes would suffice to arrange
the whole thing after the leads had once been fitted.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_19" id="Sn5_19"></a>Leads and lamps always ready, and easily fixed up.</span>
The leads once fitted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
for this purpose would be always ready for use, and
could be kept coiled away in a box which might also have a compartment to
contain the dozen or so of lamps required.</p>

<p>If the dynamo is already running as many lamps as it is capable of, some of
the bedroom lights may be turned off while the quarter-deck is being
lighted. Another thing which I think has not yet been done is the
following.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_20" id="Sn5_20"></a>Lighting of ships&#8217; holds.</span>
When working cargo at night, and indeed during the day to some extent,
lights are of necessity used in the holds.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_21" id="Sn5_21"></a>Danger of fire with oil lamps.</span>
The <i>theory</i> is, that no naked lights shall be allowed, but the <i>practice</i>
is this: lamps are taken below, get knocked about, the wicks fall down and
want pricking up, the lamps are opened for this purpose, and as they are
found to give more light without a dusty glass round them than with it,
they are left open. Candles are often taken below lighted, and even matches
struck to see the mark on a bale. I am aware that arc lamps are used in the
Royal Albert Docks, London, in connection with the dock lighting, lamps
being carried below when required, with flexible leads attached, and that,
in some few steamers, arc lamps have been used in the same manner in
connection with their own plant.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_22" id="Sn5_22"></a>Arc lamps not suitable.</span>
These arc lamps are, I think, not nearly as suitable as incandescent lamps
for the purpose of lighting up a ship&#8217;s hold; the light is too glaring, and
casts deep shadows amongst the bales and cases, besides which, the lamps
are large and clumsy.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_23" id="Sn5_23"></a>Arrangement of leads for incandescent lamps.</span>
I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
would suggest that leads should be carried behind the stringer-battens
in the ship&#8217;s side, or along under the next upper-deck, having simple
sockets or holders for incandescent lamps at certain intervals. Whoever
might be in charge of the hold would screw or hook on the lamps as
required, and so light up every part of the hold thoroughly while work was
going on.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_24" id="Sn5_24"></a>Work carried on better, and pilfering of cargo prevented.</span>
There would be no risk of fire, and I am convinced that the extra leads and
lamps would pay for themselves in a very short time, because work would get
on more quickly, and pilfering of the cargo would be in a great measure put
a stop to.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_25" id="Sn5_25"></a>Hold leads disconnected while at sea.</span>
The leads for the holds could be so arranged as to be quite unconnected
with the dynamo while at sea, so that there could not be the remotest
possibility of the current finding its way below when not wanted. In fine,
there is no reason whatever why a ship&#8217;s hold should not be lighted up when
required, as well as a warehouse or store on shore.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig21" id="Fig21"></a><p class="captop">Fig. 21.</p>
<img src="images/illo046a.png" alt="Position of Brushes" /></div>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_26" id="Sn5_26"></a>Installation complete.</span>
Now, we will suppose that our installation is complete, ready for working,
everything having been pronounced in order by the electrician who has
looked after the work.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_27" id="Sn5_27"></a>Lights wanted as night approaches.</span>
Evening is approaching, and the lights will soon be required; we must
therefore see that our engine and dynamo are ready for a start.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_28" id="Sn5_28"></a>Precautions before starting dynamo.</span>
If the engine and dynamo are separate, the belt must be felt, to see that
it is tight enough, otherwise it must be tightened by whatever means are
provided for the purpose.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_29" id="Sn5_29"></a>Lubrication must be perfect.</span>
We must also see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
that the engine and dynamo are properly oiled, and that
the worsteds are down the tubes of the oil-cups, and working properly, not
dry, as I have known them to be, with fatal results to the dynamo.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_30" id="Sn5_30"></a>Commutators and collectors require very little oil.</span>
If the lubrication is performed by means of tubes leading to each bearing from an
elevated oil-box, we must see that the oil really gets to the bearings, and
regulate its flow as required.
The commutators and collector-rings and rubbers require only a wipe of oil,
just sufficient to prevent undue wearing of the surfaces; if too much is
put on them, they will spark a great deal, and sparking will wear them away
more quickly than friction.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_31" id="Sn5_31"></a>Position of brushes.</span>
The brushes of copper wire which collect the current of the exciter dynamo,
and others of similar pattern, must be placed so that the ends press on the
commutator as shown in <a href="#Fig21">Fig. 21</a>. The ends should project just a little way
beyond the point or line of contact, and when the dynamo is running, there
should be very little sparking. I am supposing that our plant consists of
an alternating-current dynamo with a small exciter. The wires leading from
the exciter to the other dynamo remain always connected, as there is no
need for meddling with them.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig22" id="Fig22"></a><p class="captop">Fig. 22.</p>
<img src="images/illo046b.png" alt="Pointing Needle of Pocket-Compass" /></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_32" id="Sn5_32"></a>Start the engine.</span>
We will now start the engine, and thereby set the dynamo going round,
slowly at first, and gradually up to the speed required.
The main switches are not yet turned on, so there is no current going
through the leads as yet; what then is being done?
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_33" id="Sn5_33"></a>Switches not turned on.</span>
A current is being produced by the exciter only, and is magnetising the
electro-magnets of the larger dynamo,
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_33a" id="Sn5_33a"></a>No current except from exciter.</span>
and if we want to know if it is really doing its work as intended, we just
hold a small pocket-compass over the ends of two opposite magnets of the
dynamo, and observe how the needle points.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_34" id="Sn5_34"></a>Testing work of exciter.</span>
It should at once take up the
position shown in <a href="#Fig22">Fig. 22</a>, and if then held over the next couple in like
manner, the needle should simply turn round, and point in exactly the
opposite direction. If it points in any other direction, there is something
wrong with the connections. If, however, the connections are right at
starting, they will of course remain right, and there should be no need for
this test.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_35" id="Sn5_35"></a>Dynamos very powerful magnets.</span>
It is well to remember that when dynamos are working, they are, or contain
for the time being, very powerful magnets, therefore if we bend over them
to examine them,
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_36" id="Sn5_36"></a>Look out for your watches!</span>
our watches will get magnetised, which does not improve their qualities as
time-keepers. Say that our dynamo is now going round at the required speed,
which may be 500 or 600 revolutions per minute; the engine is not using
much steam as yet, because very little work is being done.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_37" id="Sn5_37"></a>Switch on the lamps.</span>
We now switch on a set of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span> lamps; this closes the circuit,
and the large dynamo begins to produce its alternating current, which goes
through the lamps and lights them up. <span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_38" id="Sn5_38"></a>Current is produced in large dynamo.</span>
This, however, gives the engine more
work to do, and more steam must be turned on, otherwise the necessary speed
will not be kept up. We switch on all the other lamps as required, and must
see that the speed of the dynamo is kept constant.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_39" id="Sn5_39"></a>Difference of a few lamps compensated by governor.</span>
A difference of a few lamps, affecting the engine to a small extent only,
should be compensated automatically by the governor. If the brightest lamps
are not bright enough, the speed should be increased a little, but care
must be taken not to overdo it, because if the current is too strong, some
of the safety fuses will melt, and the corresponding lamps will go out. It
must not be inferred from what I have said, that it is necessary to run the
dynamo at first without switching on any lamps.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_40" id="Sn5_40"></a>Turn all lamps on, and light up gradually.</span>
On the contrary, a better effect will be produced if all the lamps are
switched on before starting, as they will then gradually work up to their
full brilliancy; whereas, if one set of lamps is started first, and run
bright, and we then switch on another set, the current at first will be too
small for the two sets, and the first set will get quite dull, remaining so
until the dynamo is going at its proper speed again.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_41" id="Sn5_41"></a>Inequality of light in different lamps.</span>
When lighted up for the first time, it will be found that some of the lamps
are much brighter than others; this is because the lamps at present
made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
are not of perfectly equal resistances. We must go round, then, and note
where the dull ones are, and we can either at once, or during next day,
shift them into the bathrooms and places where such a perfect light is not
required. All the lamps in one room, the first saloon, or music room, for
instance, should be equalised as much as possible, and in such places the
brightest should be used. Nothing looks worse than to see a couple of dull
lights in the same room as a lot of bright ones. By seeing to these matters
we can make the lighting much more satisfactory than it otherwise would be.
During the first few evenings we shall probably have some of the lamps go
out through the filaments breaking.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_42" id="Sn5_42"></a>Weeding out of bad lamps.</span>
This I consider a weeding out of defective lamps, because if it were that
the current was too strong, the fuses would have given way. Some of the
fuses give way when the current is <i>not</i> too strong; this is owing to
imperfections in the fuses, and they must be replaced by spare ones.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_43" id="Sn5_43"></a>Lamps not to be run too bright.</span>
For the sake of economy, it is well not to run the lamps too bright.
Without giving the lamps the maximum current a very good light can be
obtained, and they will last all the longer. I need hardly say that there
is a medium in this as in everything else, and it does not look well when a
candle is placed alongside of an electric lamp to enable a person to read
or write in comfort.</p>

<p>All this time the dynamo is running, and we must feel the bearings
occasionally to see if they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span> are keeping cool.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_44" id="Sn5_44"></a>No trouble with dynamo if oiling is attended to.</span>
There will be no trouble if the lubrication is all right. If the oil does
not get into the bearings as it should do, they will heat, jam the spindle,
or seize, and bring up the engine or break the belt. The lights will then
all go out, and everybody will say hard things of the electric light, while
the fault really rests with us.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_45" id="Sn5_45"></a>Seizing.</span>
Sometimes seizing occurs through the spindle not being slack enough in the
bearings, but this generally occurs while testing the dynamo at the works.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_46" id="Sn5_46"></a>Oil must be thin.</span>
It must be borne in mind that in dynamos the spindle must be a good fit,
and there may be room in the bearings for ordinary engine-oil while there
may not be for a thicker oil, such as castor oil. Therefore, if the
bearings show a tendency to heat, it may improve matters to thin the oil
used with petroleum. While giving the dynamo its proper supply of oil, we
must only apply it in the proper places. If we let the bobbins get
smothered in oil, the insulating material on the wire will get rotted, and
a short circuiting will probably take place.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_47" id="Sn5_47"></a>The dynamo must be kept clean.</span>
The dynamo cannot be kept too clean, and there should be a canvas cover to
put over it while not in use, especially while coaling. We will suppose
that all is going on right; a steward comes along and says:
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_48" id="Sn5_48"></a>Little troubles with the lamps.</span>
&#8220;Mr. So-and-so, I cannot get the lamp in number 6 berth to light although I
have turned the switch the right way.&#8221; &#8220;All right, I will go and look at
it,&#8221; you answer. Now, let us see what is the matter. We unhook
or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span> unscrew
the lamp, and look at the filament; it is not broken. We replace the lamp
again, and are careful that it makes good contact; but still no light.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_49" id="Sn5_49"></a>No safety fuse.</span>
Let us look at the safety fuse; why, there is none! it has been missed out.
We get one of the spare ones out of our electric store, and put it in its
place, and the lamp lights properly at once. We find another lamp out, and
look at it. We see at once that the filament is broken, so there is no
question about this one; it must be changed. Hallo! what is up with this
one? it goes in and out all the time like a flash light. The current must
be getting to it all right, otherwise it would not light at all. I see what
it is; it is a Swan lamp, and the spring is not pressing quite fairly on
it, so that one hook is making good contact,
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_50" id="Sn5_50"></a>Effect of vibration of ship on lamps.</span>
while the other tightens and slacks with the vibration of the ship. This is
soon set right by turning the spring round a little, or hooking the lamp
the other way.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_51" id="Sn5_51"></a>What to look to if a lamp is out.</span>
Or it is an Edison lamp, which has got slightly unscrewed, and no longer
makes good contact at the back end of the holder. In some lamp-fittings the
ends of the leads are held in a spring grip in the base of the bracket, and
it may happen that they have slipped out, and so broken the circuit, and
extinguished the light. In the Swan lamps, and others of a similar pattern,
one of the little platinum loops in the base of the lamps sometimes gets
broken off; the lamp is then of no further use.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_52" id="Sn5_52"></a>Recapitulation.</span>
To recapitulate, if a lamp goes out, the first thing is to see if the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
filament is broken, next if it makes good contact. If it does not then
light up, see if there is any current getting to it; this may be found out
by touching the two hooks in a Swan holder, or the back and side of an
Edison screw holder, with a moistened finger.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_53" id="Sn5_53"></a>A current of 50 volts is hardly felt.</span>
With a current of 50 volts a slight tickling sensation will be felt if the
current is passing through. If this cannot be felt, there must be some part
or other disconnected, perhaps the safety fuse has given out, or the ends
of the leads got adrift from the bracket. If in any doubt about the lamp,
try another in the same place.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_54" id="Sn5_54"></a>Incandescent lights for side lights.</span>
In some steamers incandescent lamps are used in the side lamps; they can
easily be fitted for this purpose, especially when the ship is provided
with lighthouses built in, as in the Anchor Line steamers. Two or more
incandescent lamps can be arranged on a small stand, which will slide into
the lantern, taking the place of the regulation oil lamp, and connected by
flexible leads to the other leads. It would be easy to put six 20-candle
power lamps in a group in each lantern, as it does not matter in what
position they are placed; two might be used on ordinary occasions, while on
a foggy night, the whole six could be switched on. If one lamp went out
through the filament giving way, it would not affect the others, so that
there would still be a light in the lantern. If, through some breakdown of
the engine or dynamo, the electric current were no longer to be had, then
it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_55" id="Sn5_55"></a>Mast-head light.</span>
would only be necessary to withdraw the stand of lamps, and put in the
ordinary regulation oil-lamp.
The mast-head lamp could also be fitted with the electric light, as indeed
has already been done.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_56" id="Sn5_56"></a>Arc light should never be used.</span>
On no account, however, should an arc light be used, as besides being too
dazzling, it is much too uncertain; in fact many other reasons could be
given for rejecting it. It is even a question whether it is an advantage to
have incandescent lamps for a mast-head light. There is certainly the great
advantage of not having to pull the lamp up and down to trim it, a rather
risky performance in heavy weather, and also of the light not being
affected by any wind that may get into the lamp; though as regards the
first, English officers would never be satisfied to see a lamp dangling on
the stay all day long, as appears to be the custom in some foreign
steamers, besides which it would have to be lowered to be cleaned outside.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_57" id="Sn5_57"></a>Present mast-head lights quite powerful enough.</span>
The present mast-head lights are quite powerful enough already, too much so
when compared with the side lights. I am not aware of any collisions having
occurred through a mast-head light not being seen in time, but how many
from the side lights not being seen! It was no doubt contemplated, as
indeed the regulations show, that no lights should be visible about a
vessel, except the regulation lights;
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_58" id="Sn5_58"></a>On passenger steamers, side one blaze of light, and side lights barely
visible.</span>
but many who have seen a large passenger steamer go past will have noticed
how her side was&mdash;one,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
two, or three rows of dazzling bright lights, and
will have looked almost in vain for the green or red light dimly visible in
the midst of all the bright ones. If bright electric lights, therefore, are
shining through the ports, we must have our side lights at least as bright,
so as to give them a chance of being seen. If electric lamps are used as
side lights, the dynamo must be kept running all night. If it is thought
desirable to put out all unnecessary lights at 11 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span>, the leads can be so
arranged that these lights can be all on one or more circuits, and the
necessary ones on another.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_59" id="Sn5_59"></a>Speed of dynamo constant, but steam power used in proportion to number
of lamps in use.</span>
Although the dynamo will have to go at nearly the same speed throughout the
night, it will not have the same amount of work to do, and the engine will
therefore use much less steam, the consumption being in proportion to the
number of lights used. An economical engineer will therefore see that
bedroom lamps are not kept lighted all the evening without any necessity.
On shore we should never think of keeping gas-lights blazing away for no
purpose, and why should we use electricity with more lavishness, especially
when it is so easy to turn a light on or off. The switches might with
advantage be painted with Balmain&#8217;s luminous paint, and there would then be
no trouble in finding them in the dark.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_60" id="Sn5_60"></a>No danger to life from electric current on board ship.</span>
It is well to know that on board ship, probably in all cases of electric
lighting, there is no danger to life to be apprehended from touching any<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
of the leads where bare, or indeed any part of the dynamos, as the E.M.F.
is usually not more than 50 volts. It is best, however, not to try any
experiments, and it is a good general rule, not to touch a bare part of a
dynamo or lead with both hands at the same time. The fear of getting hurt
has the good effect of keeping passengers and others from meddling with
their lamps.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_61" id="Sn5_61"></a>Binnacle lamps. Electric light not suitable.</span>
I have said nothing about the use of electric lights in binnacles, though
it would be a great advantage to be able to supply them with a good steady
light quite unaffected by wind. There is an obstacle to their use for this
purpose, in that the electric current being used near the compass, the
latter is affected by it. In theory, an alternating current should have no
effect; but it would require very exhaustive experiments to be made before
enough confidence could be inspired concerning its innocence, and I fancy
it would usually be looked upon with great suspicion by captains and
officers of ships.
<span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_62" id="Sn5_62"></a>Dynamo, if near a compass, will affect it.</span>
The dynamo being made up of powerful magnets, must of course be always at a
good distance from the compasses. In some installations on iron steamers,
the return leads have been dispensed with, the iron of the ship carrying
the current back, in the same way that the earth or sea does it in a
telegraph circuit.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote"><a name="Sn5_63" id="Sn5_63"></a>Notes.</span>
It is to be observed that a dynamo with <i>brushes</i> on the commutator is not
necessarily a <i>Brush</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span> dynamo as a good many people seem to think, the
latter being named after its inventor, Mr. Brush.</p>

<p>A dynamo is not a <i>battery</i> as some people call it, and there is no need
for multiplying names.</p>

<p>A pocket speed-indicator should be supplied for testing the speed of the
dynamo, to see that it is kept up to proper speed, and that the belt (if
used) does not slip to an unreasonable extent.</p>

<p>I think I have now said enough to redeem my introductory promise, and if I
have, so to speak, let more electric light on to a subject previously dark
to a good many people, I shall be well satisfied with my labour, and I hope
that those who peruse this book will be induced to go more deeply into the
subject by means of the many good books which have been written by cleverer
men than I, and which enter more thoroughly into all its details.</p>

<p class="blockquot">This work is not, in any sense, an elementary treatise, or history of
the steam engine, but is intended to describe examples of Fixed Steam
Engines without entering into the wide domain of locomotive or marine
practice. To this end illustrations will be given of the most recent
arrangements of Horizontal, Vertical, Beam, Pumping, Winding,
Portable, Semi-portable, Corliss, Allen, Compound, and other similar
Engines, by the most eminent Firms in Great Britain and America. The
laws relating to the action and precautions to be observed in the
construction of the various details, such as Cylinders, Pistons,
Piston-rods, Connecting-rods, Cross-heads, Motion-blocks, Eccentrics,
Simple, Expansion, Balanced, and Equilibrium Slide-valves, and
Valve-gearing will be minutely dealt with. In this connection will be
found articles upon the Velocity of Reciprocating Parts and the Mode
of Applying the Indicator, Heat and Expansion of Steam Governors, and
the like. It is the writer&#8217;s desire to draw illustrations from every
possible source, and give only those rules that present practice deems
correct.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
